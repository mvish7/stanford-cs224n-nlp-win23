This repo contains lecture notes and assignments stanford's CS224N course of NLP.

## Lecture Notes
These are the notes I took to easily revise the course contents when needed. You find also some handwritten notes every now and then. These notes are only to be used as supplimentary material. The original lecture content still and will always remain as a source of truth.

## TODO
- [ ] Upload remaining notes, lecture 3 to 16.
- [ ] Upload assignments 2 to 5


## Copyright
The original lectures and assignments can be found on [CS224n](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1234/) website. The ownership of CS224N course material lies with Stanford and this work is mere summarization for self-understanding.
