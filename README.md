# stanford-cs224n-nlp-win23
This repo contains lecture notes and assignments stanford's CS224N course of NLP. During the year 2024, I completed this course by referring to the course website (linked below) and lecture videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMFqRtEuo6SGjY4XbRIVRd4)

## Lecture Notes
These are the notes I took to easily revise the course contents when needed. You find also some handwritten notes every now and then. These notes are only to be used as supplimentary material. The original lecture content still and will always remain as the source of truth.\
A disclamer: I used Microsoft OneNote to take these notes, While exporting these notes to PDFs I faced several issues e.g. rigid page splits, hand-writen text being mixed with images/typed texts etc. 
I have tried to mitigate these issues by changing the page size, scale factor etc. If you find these notes unusable, I'll be happy to provide a read-access to original one note notebook.

## Assignments:
I have provided the solutions of the assignments here in this repo. I wholeheartedly request the reader to attempt solving the assigments on their own and refer to solutions if any only if they are absoutely stuck. I would also like to thank [@floriankark](https://github.com/floriankark/cs224n-win2223/tree/main) for making his solutions public as I referred his work in the time of need. 

## TODO
